# PairCoding

Pair Coding is a professional web-based platform designed to facilitate real-time, collaborative programming sessions for developers. The application allows users to either host or join a private coding session. To host a session, you're prompted to create a unique private key that can be securely shared with other developers, granting them exclusive access. Upon entering a session, all participants are presented with a shared document that updates in real time. To maintain code integrity, the platform utilizes a controlled editing model where only one person can write to the file at a time; a user must request editing privileges, which must be approved by the other user in the session. Once the session is complete, the file can be saved to the cloud for future access or downloaded directly to your local machine.
